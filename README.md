# Cash Flow Manager
A test assignment from the IT-Solutions company.

---

## Description
An application for accounting of all monetary transactions 
(test task from IT Solutions). DDS (Cash flow) is the process of accounting, 
managing, and analyzing the receipts and writeâ€”offs of funds from a company or 
individual. The application provides the user with the ability to keep records 
of all monetary transactions.

## Setup and launch
To demonstrate how the application works, it is enough to assemble docker containers with 
the ```docker compose up --build``` command. To access the admin area, you will need to go into 
the container terminal with the django application and create a superuser. 
To fill the database, you can upload a fixture /cf_manager/fixture.json. 
If you are using docker compose, you can log into the container terminal 
with the django application (```docker compose exec -ti app /bin/sh```), 
activate the virtual environment (```. .venv/bin/activate```), 
and execute the command (```python ./cf_manager/manage.py loaddata ./cf_manager/fixture.json```).
After that, you can log in to the admin panel with 
**username: admin, password: admin, email: test@test.test**

If the application is running locally via docker (with nginx), 
then the application will work by url. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.

The application implements an API with all the basic CRUD methods. Endpoints:

- ```/cash_flows/api/``` - Methods for working with cash flows
- ```/reference_books/api/statuses/``` - Methods for working with statuses
- ```/reference_books/api/types/``` - Methods for working with types
- ```/reference_books/api/categories/``` - Methods for working with categories
- ```/reference_books/api/subcategories/``` - Methods for working with subcategories

For more information about the API, you can go to the following endpoints:
- ```/api/schema/``` - yml file with openapi specification
- ```/api/schema/swagger/``` - Swagger
- ```/api/schema/redoc``` - Redoc
